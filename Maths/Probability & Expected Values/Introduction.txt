# Experiment: An activity which has an associated outcome.

# Random Variable (RV): --->
  • Every experiment will have a set of possible outcomes.
  • If we associate a RV with an experiment, then after performing the experiment that RV is going
    to take one of the values among the possible set of outcomes of that experiment.
  • Or more formally we can say that a RV is a real-valued variable whose value is determined by an
    underlying experiment i.e. outcome of the experiment.

# Expected value: --->
  • If I conduct an experiment right now, then what is the most likely value that I would get as an
    outcome ?
  • More formally, let us say I conduct an experiment n times and I name the experiments e1, e2, e3..
    ...en and let's say the outcomes are x1, x2, x3...xn. 
    Then, the Expected value of a RV X, denoted as E(X) = lim n tends to ∞ (Σxi)/n.
