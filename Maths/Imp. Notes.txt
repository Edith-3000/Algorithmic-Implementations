# Number of numbers in the range [X, Y] divisible by Z are ==>
  (Y/Z) - (X/Z) , if X % Z != 0
  (Y/Z) - (X/Z) + 1 , if X % Z == 0

# Sum of 2 numbers 'a' and 'b' will be divisible by 'k' ==>
  iff sum of their remainders is divisible by 'k' i.e. ((a % k) + (b % k)) % k = 0.

# Upper bound on the #divisors of a natural number n can be taken as O(n ^ 1/3), although it's not completely
  true.

# For any integer k and positive integer n, let k mod n denote the remainder when k is divided by n. 
  More formally, r = k mod n is the smallest non-negative integer such that (k − r) is divisible by n. 
  It always holds that 0 ≤ k mod n ≤ n − 1.

  And x = (n - r) % n is the smallest non-negative integer such that (k + x) is divisible by n. 

# If m and n are nonzero integers, and more generally, nonzero elements of an integral domain, it is said that 
  m divides n, m is a divisor of n or n is a multiple of m, and this is written as m | n,
  if there exists an integer k, or an element k of the integral domain, such that m * k = n.

# If 0 <= a < m and 0 <= b < m
  then, (a + b) % m will either be equal to --->
  1. (a + b) or 
  2. a - (m - b) or b - (m - a)

# A number 'x' is divisible by (2^a) if the number produced by the last 'a' digits of 'x' is divisible 
  by (2^a), 
  * Same goes for (5^a) and (10^a).

# gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b) = gcd(a, |a-b|) = gcd(b, |a-b|)
  Note: The same thing also goes for gcd for more than 2 numbers.
