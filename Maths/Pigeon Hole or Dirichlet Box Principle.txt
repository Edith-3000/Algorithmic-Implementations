/*The Pigeonhole Principle (also known as the Dirichlet box principle, Dirichlet principle or box principle) 
  states that if (n+1) or more pigeons are placed in (n) holes, then at least one hole must contain atleast two or 
  more pigeons.

  Another definition could be phrased as, among any (n) integers, there are at least two integers with the same 
  modulo (n-1) residue.
  Here modulo (n-1) residue is the set S = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ........., (n-2)} containing (n-1) elements.
  
  The extended version of the Pigeonhole Principle states that if (k) objects are placed in (n) boxes then at least
  one box must hold at least ceil(k/n) objects, and the remaining boxes can hold at most floor(k/n) objects.

  * Pigeonhole principle strong form –
    Theorem: Let q1, q2, . . . , qn be positive integers.
             If q1+ q2+ . . . + qn – n + 1 objects are put into n boxes, then either the 1st box contains at least 
             q1 objects, or the 2nd box contains at least q2 objects, . . ., the nth box contains at least qn 
             objects.

  * Another slight variation of Pigeon hole principle which can be used to solve question is-
    If there are (n+1) objects with values ranging from 1 to n, 1 & n both inclusive, then there will be atleast 2 
    objects with same value or there will be atleast one value which will be repeated.

  * Remember: (a-b)%m = ((a%m)-(b%m)+m)%m
    Remember: abs(a-b)%m != abs((a%m)-(b%m)+m)%m
