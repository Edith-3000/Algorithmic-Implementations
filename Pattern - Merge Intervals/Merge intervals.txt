Problem Statement: Given a list of intervals, merge all the overlapping intervals to produce a list 
                   that has only mutually exclusive intervals.
                   Example: Intervals: [[1,4], [2,5], [7,9]]
                            Output: [[1,5], [7,9]]
                            Explanation: Since the first two intervals [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, 
                            we merged them into one [1,5].
