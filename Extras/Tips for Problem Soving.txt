# Following are some line of thoughts to solve algorithmic problems ------>

1. You can find out all the possible conditions for the Problem Statement given.
2. Try to frame any Mathematical Eqⁿ, if suitable.
3. Although this may not work always in CP, but try to use meaningful variable names, sometimes it
   minimizes confusion.
4. Whenever you are asked to find the best subarray or subsequence & the problem involves DP, then you should
   define your DP in such a way that dp[i] store the best subarray or subsequence that ends at the iᵗʰ element.
