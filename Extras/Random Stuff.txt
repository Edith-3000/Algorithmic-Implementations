Random stuff to try when stuck:
            -if it's 2C then it's dp
            -for combo/probability problems, expand the given form we're interested in
            -make everything the same then build an answer (constructive, make everything 0 then do something)
            -something appears in parts of 2 --> model as graph
            -assume a greedy then try to show why it works
            -find way to simplify into one variable if multiple exist
            -treat it like fmc (note any passing thoughts/algo that could be used so you can revisit them)
            -find lower and upper bounds on answer
            -figure out what ur trying to find and isolate it
            -see what observations you have and come up with more continuations
            -work backwards (in constructive, go from the goal to the start)
            -turn into prefix/suffix sum argument (often works if problem revolves around adjacent array elements)
            -instead of solving for answer, try solving for complement (ex, find n-(min) instead of max)
            -draw something
            -simulate a process
            -dont implement something unless if ur fairly confident its correct
            -after 3 bad submissions move on to next problem if applicable
            -do something instead of nothing and stay organized
            -write stuff down
         Random stuff to check when wa:
            -if code is way too long/cancer then reassess
            -switched N/M
            -int overflow
            -switched variables
            -wrong MOD
            -hardcoded edge case incorrectly
         Random stuff to check when tle:
            -continue instead of break
            -condition in for/while loop bad
         Random stuff to check when rte:
            -switched N/M
            -long to int/int overflow
            -division by 0
            -edge case for empty list/data structure/N=1
