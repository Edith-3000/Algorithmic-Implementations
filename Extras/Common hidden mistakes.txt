# If the algorithm seems very robust but still don't give desired result, then check for the following
  parameters --------->
1. There might be possibility of 𝑺𝒆𝒈𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝑭𝒂𝒖𝒍𝒕.
2. It is possible that the fⁿ name or variable name you are using is a 𝒌𝒆𝒚𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒅 in the language.
3. See if the #𝑻𝒆𝒔𝒕 𝑪𝒂𝒔𝒆𝒔 are correct.
4. Be cautious whether you've passed the arguements to fⁿs. by 𝒓𝒆𝒇𝒆𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒆 or by 𝒄𝒐𝒑𝒚.
5. See if you're using 𝒄𝒐𝒓𝒓𝒆𝒄𝒕 𝒊𝒏𝒅𝒆𝒙𝒊𝒏𝒈 either 0 - based or 1 - based.
6. Don't ever use indexing to insert in container if their size hasn't been declared beforehand.
   Eg. vector<int> v;
       Then don't ever use v[i]=100;
       This will always give 𝑺𝒆𝒈𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝑭𝒂𝒖𝒍𝒕 (𝒄𝒐𝒓𝒆 𝒅𝒖𝒎𝒑𝒆𝒅).
       To correct it either use v.push_back(100);
                     or declare vector size i.e. vector<int> v(size);
7. Always check if there is only 1 𝒕𝒆𝒔𝒕 𝒄𝒂𝒔𝒆 in i/p, 𝒄𝒐𝒎𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒐𝒖𝒕 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒆 𝒄𝒊𝒏>>𝒕 𝒊𝒏 𝒚𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒕𝒆𝒎𝒑𝒍𝒂𝒕𝒆.
8. Check for the 𝑬𝑫𝑮𝑬 𝑪𝑨𝑺𝑬𝑺.
9. Remember, most of the times 𝑺𝑨𝑴𝑷𝑳𝑬 𝑰/𝑷 & 𝑶/𝑷 given are 𝑴𝑰𝑺𝑳𝑬𝑨𝑫𝑰𝑵𝑮.
9. Don't 𝑨𝑺𝑺𝑼𝑴𝑬 𝒂𝒏𝒚𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈 by 𝒚𝒐𝒖𝒓𝒔𝒆𝒍𝒇, follow the things written in problem statement, no self assumption.
10. Sometimes there are questions having possibility of 𝑴𝑼𝑳𝑻𝑰𝑷𝑳𝑬 𝑨𝑵𝑺𝑾𝑬𝑹𝑺, so if the o/p doesn't 
    matches with the eg. o/p just submit the code and check if answer is correct or not.
