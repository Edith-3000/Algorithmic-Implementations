/*PROBLEM: You are given an array of n integers from 1 to n.
           Each integer appears exactly once except few which appears twice and few which are missing.
           Array need not be sorted.
           Return the repeating and missing numbers.
           NOTE: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
