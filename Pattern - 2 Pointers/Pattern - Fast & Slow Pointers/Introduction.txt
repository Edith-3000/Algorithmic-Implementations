# The 𝑭𝒂𝒔𝒕 & 𝑺𝒍𝒐𝒘 𝒑𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒓 𝒂𝒑𝒑𝒓𝒐𝒂𝒄𝒉, also known as the 𝑯𝒂𝒓𝒆 & 𝑻𝒐𝒓𝒕𝒐𝒊𝒔𝒆 𝒂𝒍𝒈𝒐𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒉𝒎, is a pointer 
  algorithm that uses two pointers which move through the array (or sequence/LinkedList) at different 
  speeds. This approach is quite useful when dealing with 𝒄𝒚𝒄𝒍𝒊𝒄 𝑳𝒊𝒏𝒌𝒆𝒅𝑳𝒊𝒔𝒕𝒔 𝒐𝒓 𝒂𝒓𝒓𝒂𝒚𝒔.

# By moving at different speeds (say, in a cyclic LinkedList), the algorithm proves that the two pointers 
  are bound to meet. The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer once both the pointers are in a cyclic 
  loop.
