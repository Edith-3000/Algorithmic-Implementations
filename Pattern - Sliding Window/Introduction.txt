# How to identify if SLIDING WINDOW technique can be applied in a problem ?
  * Basically if the following things are given or asked then there is a high probabilty that SLIDING 
    WINDOW technique can be used for the problem: ------>
    ♠ The problem is based on array/string/linked list.
    ♠ Something related to subarray/substring is asked.
    ♠ Something largest/minimum/maximum is asked.
    ♠ A number 'k' is given, which is basically the WINDOW SIZE.

# Types of WINDOW ---->
  1). Fixed Sized Window.
  2). Variable Sized Window.
