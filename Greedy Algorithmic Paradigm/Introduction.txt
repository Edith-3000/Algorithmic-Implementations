# Greedy Algorithms are one of the most intuitive algorithms. 
# Whenever we see a problem we first try to apply some greedy strategy to get the answer.

# Greedy Algorithm always makes the choice that 𝒍𝒐𝒐𝒌𝒔 𝒃𝒆𝒔𝒕 𝒂𝒕 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒎𝒐𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕.
# We hope that by choosing a 𝒍𝒐𝒄𝒂𝒍 𝒐𝒑𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒖𝒎 at each step, we will end up at a 𝒈𝒍𝒐𝒃𝒂𝒍 𝒐𝒑𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒖𝒎.
  
  for eg., from a point there are 5 available paths (& weight is associated with each path), then 
  • by brute force and DP paradigms we will choose all the paths and proceed further,
  • but by greedy strategy we'll select the most optimal path at the current moment and then proceed further.

# So DP considers all the choices, while Greedy also CONSIDERS all the choices BUT CHOOSES only ONE CHOICE 
  to continue with.

# Every Greedy solution can be solved using Dynamic programming.

# For a problem that can be solved using DP and Greedy ==>
  • O(memory) (DP) >= O(memory) (Greedy) 
  • O(time) (DP) >= O(time) (Greedy)

# For further explanation for the difference b/w Greedy and DP refer the pdf notes.
