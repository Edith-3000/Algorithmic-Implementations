# The process of printing o/p on the console(or screen) is an 𝑬𝑿𝑷𝑬𝑵𝑺𝑰𝑽𝑬 process.
# Programming languages try to store the o/p (i.e. they try to buffer the o/p) & when the program terminates
  all of the o/p is printed 𝑨𝑻 𝑶𝑵𝑬 𝑮𝑶.

# ∴ in order to solve interactive problems, after giving printing command, we tell the program to not
  to store the o/p in a buffer instead flush it out onto the screen then and there only.
