# Whenever we are given ‘K’ sorted arrays, we can use a Heap to efficiently perform a sorted traversal 
  of all the elements of all arrays.

# We can push the smallest (first) element of each sorted array in a Min Heap to get the overall minimum. 

# While inserting elements to the Min Heap we keep track of which array the element came from. 

# We can, then, remove the top element from the heap to get the smallest element and push the next element 
  from the same array, to which this smallest element belonged, to the heap. 
  
# We can repeat this process to make a sorted traversal of all elements.
