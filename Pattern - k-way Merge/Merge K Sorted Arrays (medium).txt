/*Problem Statement: Given a list of ‘K’ sorted arrays, merge them into one sorted list.
*/

/*UNDERLYING CONCEPT ------>
  This problem is similar to Merge K Sorted Lists except that the input is a list of arrays compared 
  to LinkedLists. To handle this, we can use a similar approach as discussed in our parent problem by 
  keeping a track of the array and the element indices.
