# A convex polygon is defined as a polygon with all its interior angles less than 180°. 
  This means that all the vertices of the polygon will point outwards, away from the interior of the shape. 
  Think of it as a 'bulging' polygon. Note that a triangle (3-gon) is always convex.

# A convex polygon is the opposite of a concave polygon.

# Or we can also say that convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the given points.

# A polygon is a closed planar figure consisting of straight line segments. 
  There are two types of polygons: convex and concave.

# A polygon can be regular or irregular. A polygon is regular if all sides are the same length and all angles 
  are congruent.

# In their most general form, polygons are an ordered set of vertices, {A₁, A₂, A₃ ... Aₙ}, n >= 3 with
  edges {A₁A₂, A₂A₃, A₃A₄, ... AₙA₁} joining consecutive vertices. Most frequently, one deals with simple 
  polygons in which no two edges are allowed to intersect. (In fact, the adjective "simple" is almost always
  omitted, so the term "polygon" should be understood to mean "simple polygon" unless otherwise noted.)

# A degenerate polygon is one in which some vertex lies on an edge joining two other vertices. 
  This can happen in one of two ways: either the vertices A₍ᵢ₋₁₎, Aᵢ and A₍ᵢ₊₁₎ can be colinear or the vertices
  Aᵢ and A₍ᵢ₊₁₎ can overlap (fail to be distinct). In either of these cases, our polygon of (n) vertices 
  will appear to have (n - 1) or fewer -- it will have "degenerated" from an n-gon to an (n - 1)-gon. 
  (In the case of triangles, this will result in either a line segment or a point.)
