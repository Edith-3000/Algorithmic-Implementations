/*PROBLEM STATEMENT: Given an array of words, find all shortest unique prefixes to represent each word in 
                     the given array. Assume that no word is prefix of another.
                     Example:
                     Input: arr[] = {"zebra", "dog", "duck", "dove"}
                     Output: dog, dov, du, z
                     Explanation: dog => dog
                                  dove = dov 
                                  duck = du
                                  z   => zebra

/*UNDERLYING CONCEPT:
  # 𝑷𝑹𝑶𝑩𝑳𝑬𝑴𝑺 𝑰𝑵𝑽𝑶𝑳𝑽𝑰𝑵𝑮 𝑷𝑹𝑬𝑭𝑰𝑿𝑬𝑺 𝑪𝑨𝑵 𝑩𝑬 𝑺𝑶𝑳𝑽𝑬𝑫 𝑼𝑺𝑰𝑵𝑮 "𝑻𝑹𝑰𝑬".
  # A simple brute force solution is to consider every prefix of every word (starting from the shortest to
    largest), and if a prefix is not prefix of any other string, then print it.
    But it's not efficient.
  # An Efficient Solution is to use Trie.
