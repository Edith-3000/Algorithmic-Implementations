* THOSE WHO CAN'T REMEMBER THE PAST ARE CONDEMNED TO REPEAT IT - Dynamic Programming.

* Dynamic programming is all about breaking down an optimization problem into simpler
  sub-problems, and storing the solution to each sub-problem so that each sub-problem 
  is solved only once.

* This method was developed by Richard Bellman in the 1950s.
