/*PROBLEM: Given a 2-D matrix, find the number of ways to reach cell with coordinates (m, n) from 
           starting cell (0,0) under the condition that you can only travel any number of steps right or any
           number of steps down.
           Note: # 𝑵𝒐 𝒄𝒆𝒍𝒍𝒔 𝒐𝒇 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒎𝒂𝒕𝒓𝒊𝒙 𝒂𝒓𝒆 𝒃𝒍𝒐𝒄𝒌𝒆𝒅.
                 # m and n are given on 0 based indexing.
*/

/*UNDERLYING CONCEPT ----->
  # An approach similar to "Count all possible paths (Right & down 1 step)" can be used.
  # THe only difference is we've to add all the values of cells left and top to find answer for the 
    current cell into consideration in the TABULATION IMPLEMENTATION.
  # The formula will be -------->
                
    dp[m][n] = ∑dp[m][k]  + ∑dp[k][n]
              (k=0 to n-1) (k=0 to m-1)
  
  # Time complexity: O(m*n*max(m, n))
  # Auxiliary Space(worsst case): O(r*c), where r and c are the #rows and #columns in the given 2 D Matrix.
