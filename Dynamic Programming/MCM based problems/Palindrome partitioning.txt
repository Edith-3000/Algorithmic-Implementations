/*PROBLEM: Given a string, a partitioning of the string is a palindrome partitioning 
           if every substring of the partition is a palindrome. For example, 
           “aba|b|bbabb|a|b|aba” is a palindrome partitioning of “ababbbabbababa”. Determine
           the fewest cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of a given string. For 
           example, minimum of 3 cuts are needed for “ababbbabbababa”. The three cuts are “a|babbbab|b|ababa”. If a string is a palindrome, then minimum 0 cuts are needed. 
           If a string of length n containing all different characters, then minimum n-1 cuts 
           are needed.

           eg. String =  ababbbabbababa
               Palindrome partitioning = a|babbbab|b|ababa
               Min #cuts required = 3
