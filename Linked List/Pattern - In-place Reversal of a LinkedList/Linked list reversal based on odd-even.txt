Problem Statement: Given a LinkedList with ‘n’ nodes, reverse it based on its size in the 
                   following way:
                   1. If ‘n’ is even, reverse the list in a group of n/2 nodes.
                   2. If n is odd, keep the middle node as it is, reverse the first ‘n/2’ nodes and reverse 
                      the  last ‘n/2’ nodes.
*/

/*UNDERLYING CONCEPT: ---->
  # This problem can be easily converted to the parent problem of Reversing a sublist from 'k' to 'l'; 
    We can call this fⁿ 2 times.

  # When ‘n’ is even we can perform the following steps:
    1). Reverse first ‘n/2’ nodes: head = reverseSubList(head, 1, n/2)
    2). Reverse last ‘n/2’ nodes: head = reverseSubList(head, n/2 + 1, n)
  
  # When ‘n’ is odd, our algorithm will look like:
    1). head = reverseSubList(head, 1, n/2)
    2). head = reverseSubList(head, n/2 + 2, n)
    * NOTE: in the function call in 2ⁿᵈ step, we’re skipping two elements as we will be skipping 
           the middle element.
