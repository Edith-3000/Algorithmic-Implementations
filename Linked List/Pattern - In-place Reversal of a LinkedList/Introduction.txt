# In a lot of problems, we are asked to reverse the links between a set of nodes of a LinkedList. 
  Often, the constraint is that we need to do this in-place, i.e., using the existing node objects and 
  without using extra memory.

# In-place Reversal of a LinkedList pattern describes an efficient way to solve the above types of 
  problems.
