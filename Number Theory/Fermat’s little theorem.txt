/* # Fermat’s little theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, the number 
     (aᵖ – a) is an integer multiple of p.

   # Here p is a prime number
     aᵖ ≡ a (mod p).

   # Special Case: If a is not divisible by p (or we can say 'a' is co-prime with 'p'), 
     Fermat’s little theorem is equivalent to the statement that 
     a⁽ᵖ⁻¹⁾-1 is an integer multiple of p.
	 a⁽ᵖ⁻¹⁾ ≡ 1 (mod p)
	 OR
	 a⁽ᵖ⁻¹⁾ % p = 1
	 Here a is not divisible by p (or we can say 'a' is co-prime with 'p').
