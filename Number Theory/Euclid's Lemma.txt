# We are given two numbers x and y. We know that a number p divides their product. 
  Can we say for sure that p also divides one of them?
# The answer is no. For example, consider x = 15, y = 6 and p = 9. p divides the product 15*6, but doesn’t
  divide any of them.

# What if 𝒑 𝒊𝒔 𝒑𝒓𝒊𝒎𝒆?
# Euclid’s lemma states that if a prime p divides the product of two numbers (x*y), it must divide at least one 
  of those numbers.
  For example x = 15, y = 6 and p = 5. p divides the product 15*6, it also divides 15.

# The idea is simple, since p is prime, it cannot be factorized. So it must either be completely present in 
  x or in y.
