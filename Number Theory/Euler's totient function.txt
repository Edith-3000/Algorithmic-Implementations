/*# Euler's totient function, also known as phi-function ϕ(n), counts the number of integers between 1 and n 
    inclusive, which are coprime to n. 
  # Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor equals 1 (1 is considered to be coprime to any  
    number).

  # n = p₁ᵏ¹ * p₂ᵏ² *..........* pₖᵏⁿ, i.e. the prime factorization of n, then 
    ϕ(n) = n*(1−1/p₁)*(1−1/p₂)*(1-1/p₃)........(1−1/pₖ)
