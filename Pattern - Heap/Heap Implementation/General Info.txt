# A heap is a COMPLETE BINARY TREE, the reason being in most of the algorithms they are represented
  using arrays and there must be no gap in array elements for space optimizations.
  However, they can also be implemented using linked list.

# A COMPLETE BINARY TREE is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely
  filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

# A FULL BINARY TREE (sometimes proper binary tree or 2-tree) is a tree in which every node other than 
  the leaves has two children

# A PERFECT BINARY TREE is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes 
  and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.

# Every number in the heap must be >= all its descendents in case of max heap and vice-versa for min heap.

# As heap is a complete binary tree, therefore the height of the tree will always be O(log(n)), i.e.
  it won't increase unnecessarily.

# Heap is not used for searching purposes but for other causes.

# From heap you can only delete the root element.
