# Any problem that asks to find the 𝒕𝒐𝒑/𝒔𝒎𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒆𝒔𝒕/𝒍𝒂𝒓𝒈𝒆𝒔𝒕/𝒇𝒓𝒆𝒒𝒖𝒆𝒏𝒕 ‘𝑲’ 𝒆𝒍𝒆𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒔 among a given set falls
  under this pattern.

# The best data structure that comes to mind to keep track of ‘K’ elements is Heap. This pattern will make
  use of the Heap to solve multiple problems dealing with ‘K’ elements at a time from a set of given 
  elements.

# Thumb Rule ---> ♠ If 'K' and smallest/lowest/closest is given: make use of Max Heap.
				          ♠ If 'K' and largest/greatest/top is given: make use of Min Heap.
