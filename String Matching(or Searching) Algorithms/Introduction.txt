# In computer science, string-searching algorithms, sometimes called string-matching algorithms, are an 
  important class of string algorithms that try to find a place where one or several strings (also called patterns)
  are found within a larger string or text.

# The most basic case of string searching involves one (often very long) string, sometimes called the 𝒉𝒂𝒚𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒄𝒌,
  and one (often very short) string, sometimes called the 𝒏𝒆𝒆𝒅𝒍𝒆. 
  The goal is to find one or more occurrences of the needle within the haystack. 
  For example, one might search for "𝒕𝒐" within:
  𝑺𝒐𝒎𝒆 𝒃𝒐𝒐𝒌𝒔 𝒂𝒓𝒆 𝒕𝒐 𝒃𝒆 𝒕𝒂𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒅, 𝒐𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒔 𝒕𝒐 𝒃𝒆 𝒔𝒘𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒐𝒘𝒆𝒅, 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒔𝒐𝒎𝒆 𝒇𝒆𝒘 𝒕𝒐 𝒃𝒆 𝒄𝒉𝒆𝒘𝒆𝒅 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒅𝒊𝒈𝒆𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒅.

# There are various string matching/searching algorithms, few of them are ⟶
  • 𝑺𝒕𝒓𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒔𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒄𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒖𝒔𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒕𝒓𝒊𝒆
  • 𝑹𝒂𝒃𝒊𝒏-𝑲𝒂𝒓𝒑 𝒂𝒍𝒈𝒐𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒉𝒎 (𝑹𝒐𝒍𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒉𝒂𝒔𝒉)
  • 𝑲𝒏𝒖𝒕𝒉–𝑴𝒐𝒓𝒓𝒊𝒔–𝑷𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒕 (𝑲𝑴𝑷) 𝒂𝒍𝒈𝒐𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒉𝒎
  • 𝒁-𝒇𝒖𝒏𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏
  • 𝑴𝒂𝒏𝒂𝒄𝒉𝒆𝒓'𝒔 𝒂𝒍𝒈𝒐𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒉𝒎
