# A Fenwick tree or Binary Indexed Tree is a data structure that helps compute prefix sums efficiently.
  Computing prefix sums are often important in various other algorithms.

# The nᵗʰ prefix sum of an array is the sum of the first n elements of the array.
  This idea is also referred to as partial sums or cumulative sums.

# BITs are used to efficiently answer certain types of range queries, on ranges from a root to some 
  distant node. 
  They also allow quick updates on individual data points.
  • An example of a range query would be this: "What is the sum of the numbers indexed from [1,x]?"
  • An example of an update would be this: "Increase the number indexed by x by v."
  
  A BIT can perform both of these operations in O(log N) time, and takes O(N) memory.

# BIT[i] will store the answer for the range [l, r], 
  where l = i - 2ᵖᵒˢ + 1 and r = i
  Here pos = 0-based indexing of the 1ˢᵗ set bit in 'i'.
  * Based on observations --->
    1. For all odd indices 'i', BIT[i] will store the answer for the range [i, i]
    2. For all indices 'i' which are powers of 2, BIT[i] will store the answer for the range [1, i]

# A Segment Tree can also perform both of the operations in O(Log N) time, but 𝒄𝒐𝒎𝒑𝒂𝒓𝒆𝒅 𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒉 𝑺𝒆𝒈𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝑻𝒓𝒆𝒆,

# It is very easy to implement and can be extended for n dimensions.
