# A Segment Tree is a full binary tree data structure that allows answering range queries over an array 
  effectively, while still being flexible enough to allow modifying the array.

# Full Binary Tree vs. Complete Binary Tree: https://www.javatpoint.com/full-binary-tree-vs-complete-binary-tree

# It is a data structure based on divide and conquer strategy.

# It is used for storing the intervals or segments. Each node in the Segment Tree represents an interval.

# In general a Segment Tree is a very flexible data structure, and a huge number of problems can be solved 
  with it.

# One important property of Segment Trees is, that they require only a linear amount of memory. 
  The standard Segment Tree requires (4 x n) vertices for working on an array of size n.

# (4 * n) size is enough for an array of size n. Why?

# It is, in principle, a static structure; that is, it's a structure that cannot be modified once it's built.

# It's also known as statistic tree.

# Applications of the segment tree are in the areas of computational geometry, and geographic information 
  systems.

# The segment tree can be generalized to higher dimension spaces.

# Any operation that is associative in nature can be used with segment tree.
  An associative operation is a calculation that gives the same result regardless of the way the numbers 
  are grouped. Addition and multiplication are both associative, while subtraction and division are not.

# In conclusion a Segment Tree is useful for: 𝑹𝒂𝒏𝒈𝒆 𝒃𝒂𝒔𝒆𝒅 𝒒𝒖𝒆𝒓𝒊𝒆𝒔 + 𝑼𝒑𝒅𝒂𝒕𝒆𝒔.
# For Range based queries + updates, other approaches can also be used, such as ⟶
  • Brute force approach.
  • Using a 2D Matrix of size (n x n).
  But for larger values of n both the above methods as inefficient, thus Segment Tree comes to rescue.
