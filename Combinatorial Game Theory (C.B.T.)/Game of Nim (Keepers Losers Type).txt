# The Normal Game of Nim is of type Finders Winners type (i.e. the player who picks the last coin WINS the game).

# But in case of problem exactly similar to Game of Nim with only 1 alteration that the game is of type Keepers
  Losers type (misère game) (i.e. the player who picks the last coin LOSES the game), here is the way to 
  solve it ⟶
  
  • If all the piles are of size = 1, then
    if #piles == even, 1st player wins.
    else 2nd player wins.

  • Else if(s1 ^ s2 ^ s3 ..... ^ sk) != 0, 1st player wins.
         else 2nd player wins.
    
    where k = #piles
          si is the size of iᵗʰ pile, i ∈ [1, k]
