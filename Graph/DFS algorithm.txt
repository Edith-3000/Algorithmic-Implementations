/* # DFS is a recursive graph traversal technique.
   # DFS utilizes the “go deep, head first” philosophy in its implementation.
   # It is similar to preorder order traversal of a tree.
   # Stack data structure is used to implement DFS (∵ recursion uses internal call stack).
   # Depth-first search is used in topological sorting, scheduling problems, cycle detection in graphs, 
     and solving puzzles with only one solution, such as a maze or a sudoku puzzle.
   # Other applications involve analyzing networks, for example, testing if a graph is bipartite. 
     Depth-first search is often used as a subroutine in network flow algorithms such as the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.
   # DFS is also used as a subroutine in matching algorithms in graph theory such as the Hopcroft–Karp 
     algorithm.
   # Depth First Traversal (or Search) for a graph is similar to Depth First Traversal of a tree. 
     The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, a node may be visited twice. 
     To avoid processing a node more than once, use a boolean visited array.
   # Depth-first searches are used in mapping routes, scheduling, and finding spanning trees.
   # It employs the following rules -----> 
     Rule 1 − Visit the adjacent unvisited vertex. Push it in a stack. Mark it as visited. Display it.

               𝑩𝑭𝑺 𝑨𝑳𝑮𝑶𝑹𝑰𝑻𝑯𝑴)
     Rule 2 − If no adjacent vertex is found, pop up a vertex from the stack. (It will pop up all the 
              vertices from the stack, which do not have adjacent vertices.)
     Rule 3 − Repeat Rule 1 and Rule 2 until the stack is empty.

/* # Iterative DFS v/s Recursive DFS and different elements order ------>
   * Both are valid DFS algorithms. A DFS does not specify which node you see first. It is not important 
     because the order between edges is not defined [remember: edges are a set usually]. The difference is 
     due to the way you handle each node's children.

   * In the iterative approach: You first insert all the elements into the stack of the current node
     and then handle the head(top) of the stack [which is the last node inserted] - thus the first 
     node you handle is the last child (last adjacent neighbour) of the current node.
   * While in the recursive approach: You handle each node when you see it. Thus the first node you handle 
     is the first child (first adjacent neighbour).
   
   * These two variations of DFS visit the neighbors of each vertex in the opposite order from each other: 
     the first neighbor of v(current node) visited by the recursive variation is the first one in the list 
     of adjacent edges, 
     while in the iterative variation the first visited neighbor is the last one in the list of adjacent 
     edges.

   # To make the iterative DFS yield the same result as the recursive one - you need to add elements to 
     the stack in reverse order [for each node, insert its last child first and its first child last]

/*HOW DO YOU SOLVE A MAZE?

Depth-first search is a common way that many people naturally approach solving problems like mazes. 
First, we select a path in the maze (for the sake of the example, let's choose a path according to some 
rule we lay out ahead of time) and we follow it until we hit a dead end or reach the finishing point of 
the maze. If a given path doesn’t work, we backtrack and take an alternative path from a past junction, 
and try that path. Below is an animation of a DFS approach to solving this maze.
