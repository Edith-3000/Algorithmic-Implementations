# The father of graph theory is the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, whose famous 1736 paper, 
  "The Seven Bridges of Konigsberg," was the first treatise on the subject.

# In the 18th century, Euler was intrigued by the question of whether a route existed that would traverse
  each of the seven bridges exactly once. In demonstrating that the answer is 🅽🅾, he laid the foundation 
  for graph theory.

# Difference b/w Explicit Graph & Implicit Graph ------>
  • Explicit Graph:
    – All vertices are identified individually and represented separately.
    – All edges are identified individually and represented separately.

  • Implicit Graph:
    – Only a subset, possibly only one, of the vertices is given an explicit representation. (The others 
      are implied.) or we can say it is a graph whose vertices or edges are not represented as explicit objects 
      in a computer's memory, but rather are determined algorithmically from some more concise input.
    – Only a subset, and possibly zero, of the edges is given an explicit representation.
    – A set of “operators” is provided that can be used to construct “new” edges and vertices.
