# The father of graph theory is the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, whose famous 1736 paper, 
  "The Seven Bridges of Konigsberg," was the first treatise on the subject.

# In the 18th century, Euler was intrigued by the question of whether a route existed that would traverse
  each of the seven bridges exactly once. In demonstrating that the answer is ðŸ…½ðŸ…¾, he laid the foundation 
  for graph theory.
