# The father of graph theory is the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, whose famous 1736 paper, 
  "The Seven Bridges of Konigsberg," was the first treatise on the subject.

# In the 18th century, Euler was intrigued by the question of whether a route existed that would traverse
  each of the seven bridges exactly once. In demonstrating that the answer is 🅽🅾, he laid the foundation 
  for graph theory.

# Difference b/w Explicit Graph & Implicit Graph ------>

  • Explicit Graph:
    – All vertices are identified individually and represented separately.
    – All edges are identified individually and represented separately.

  • Implicit Graph:
    – Only a subset, possibly only one, of the vertices is given an explicit representation. (The others 
      are implied.) or we can say it is a graph whose vertices or edges are not represented as explicit objects 
      in a computer's memory, but rather are determined algorithmically from some more concise input.
    – Only a subset, and possibly zero, of the edges is given an explicit representation.
    – A set of “operators” is provided that can be used to construct “new” edges and vertices.

# 𝑪𝒐𝒎𝒑𝒍𝒆𝒕𝒆 𝒈𝒓𝒂𝒑𝒉: it is a simple undirected graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an 
                unique edge.

# 𝑪𝒐𝒎𝒑𝒍𝒆𝒕𝒆 𝒅𝒊𝒈𝒓𝒂𝒑𝒉: it is a directed graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a pair of
                  unique edges (one in each direction i.e. bi-directional edges).

# 𝑺𝒊𝒎𝒑𝒍𝒆 𝒈𝒓𝒂𝒑𝒉: A graph which has neither self loops nor multiple edges(parallel edges.) i.e. where each edge 
              connects two distinct vertices and no two edges connects the same pair of vertices is called a 
              simple graph.

# 𝑴𝒖𝒍𝒕𝒊𝒈𝒓𝒂𝒑𝒉: Any graph which contains some multiple edges is called a multigraph. In a multigraph, no self loops
            are allowed.

# 𝑷𝒔𝒆𝒖𝒅𝒐 𝒈𝒓𝒂𝒑𝒉: A graph in which self loops and multiple edges are allowed is called psuedograph.


# In all over the section following are the acronyms used ⟶
  • UG = Undirected Graph
  • DG = Directed Graph
  • UWG = Unweighted Graph
  • WG = Weighted Graph
