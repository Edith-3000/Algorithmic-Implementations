/* PROBLEM STATEMENT: There are ‘N’ tasks, labeled from ‘0’ to ‘N-1’. Each task can have some prerequisite 
					  tasks which need to be completed before it can be scheduled. Given the number of tasks 
					  and a list of prerequisite pairs, write a method to print 𝑨𝑳𝑳 possible ordering of tasks meeting all prerequisites. 

*/

/* UNDERLYING CONCEPT ------>
   # This problem is similar to the parent problem Tasks Scheduling Algo, the only difference is that we 
     need to find all the topological orderings of the tasks.
   # At any stage, if we have more than one source available and since we can choose any source, therefore, 
     in this case, we will have multiple orderings of the tasks. We can use a recursive approach with Backtracking to consider all sources at any step.

/* Time and Space Complexity ---->
   # If we don’t have any prerequisites, all combinations of the tasks can represent a topological ordering.
   # As we know, that there can be N! combinations for ‘N’ numbers, therefore the time and space complexity 
    of our algorithm will be O(V! * E) where ‘V’ is the total number of tasks and ‘E’ is the total prerequisites. 
   # We need the ‘E’ part because in each recursive call, at max, we remove (and add back) all the edges.
