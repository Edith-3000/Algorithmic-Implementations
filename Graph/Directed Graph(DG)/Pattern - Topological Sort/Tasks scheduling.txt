/* PROBLEM STATEMENT: There are ‘N’ tasks, labeled from ‘0’ to ‘N-1’. Each task can have some prerequisite
					  tasks which need to be completed before it can be scheduled. Given the number of tasks 
					  and a list of prerequisite pairs, find out if it is possible to schedule all the tasks.
*/

/*UNDERLYING CONCEPT ------>
  # This problem is asking us to find out if it is possible to find a topological ordering of the given 
    tasks. 
  # Here, the tasks are equivalent to the vertices and the prerequisites are the edges of our directed 
    graph.
  # A similar algorithm as described in "Topological sort algo.txt" to find the topological ordering of 
    the tasks. 
    If the ordering does not include all the tasks, we will conclude that some tasks have cyclic 
    dependencies and ∴ not possible to schedule the given tasks.
