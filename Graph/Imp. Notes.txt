# Star graph is the only connected graphs in which at most one vertex has degree greater than one.
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_(graph_theory)

# Dijkstra's algorithm works when distances/costs are monotonic i.e. ALL the edges are +ve, or
  ALL the edges are -ve. But remember, there must be absolutely no NEGATIVE CYCLES.

# Functional Graph: Directed graph in which every vertex has exactly one outgoing edge.
                    This is also commonly referred to as a successor graph.
