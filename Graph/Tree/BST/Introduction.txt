# Ideally only unique values must be present in a BST.

# Inorder traversal of BST always produces sorted output.

# We can construct a BST with only Preorder or Postorder or Level Order traversal. 
  Note that we can always get inorder traversal by sorting the only given traversal.

# The inorder predecessor of a node in BST is the maximum node value in its left subtree while,
  the inorder successor of a node in BST is the minimum node value in its right subtree.
  
# The height of a BALANCED binary search tree with n nodes is never more than log2(n) + 1.
