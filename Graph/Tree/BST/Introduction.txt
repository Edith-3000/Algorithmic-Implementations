# Ideally only unique values must be present in a BST.
# Inorder traversal of BST always produces sorted output.
# We can construct a BST with only Preorder or Postorder or Level Order traversal. Note that we can always 
  get inorder traversal by sorting the only given traversal.
# The inorder predecessor of a node in BST is the maximum node value in its left subtree while,
  the inorder successor of a node in BST is the minimum node value in its right subtree.
# The height of a BALANCED binary search tree with n nodes is never more than log2(n) + 1.
