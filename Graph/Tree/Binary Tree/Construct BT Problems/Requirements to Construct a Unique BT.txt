# IMPORTANT INSIGHTS :--->

  1. We CANNOT construct a UNIQUE binary tree from PREORDER and POSTORDER traversals only.

     EXCEPTION: However if only PREORDER and POSTORDER traversals are given, you can construct a UNIQUE 
                FULL binary tree.

  2. We CAN construct a UNIQUE binary tree from (INORDER and PREORDER) or (INORDER and POSTORDER) 
     traversals.

  3. Wherever it is mentioned in insight #1 and insight #2 that a unique binary tree can be constructed by
     some traversals, it is assumed that all the node values in the tree are unique.
