# Following are few formulae and properties of a BINARY TREE ⟶ 

• The 𝒎𝒂𝒙𝒊𝒎𝒖𝒎 number of nodes at level 'l' will be 2⁽ˡ⁻¹⁾. 
  Here level is the number of nodes on path from root to the node, including the root itself.
  We are considering the level of root is 1.

• 𝑴𝒂𝒙𝒊𝒎𝒖𝒎 number of nodes present in binary tree of height h is 2ʰ−1 
  𝑴𝒊𝒏𝒊𝒎𝒖𝒎 number of nodes in a binary tree of height h = h 
  Here height is the max number of nodes on root to leaf path. 
  Here we are considering height of a tree with one node is 1.

• In a binary tree with n nodes, minimum possible height or minimum number of levels are ceil(log₂(n+1)). 
  If we consider that the height of leaf node is considered as 0, then the formula will be ceil(log₂(n+1)) − 1.

• A binary tree with 'L' leaves has at least (ceil(log₂L) + 1) number of levels

• If every node of a binary tree has either 0 or 2 children, then ⟶
  #leaf nodes = #nodes with two children + 1.

• 𝑷𝒆𝒓𝒇𝒆𝒄𝒕 𝒃𝒊𝒏𝒂𝒓𝒚 𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒆 = a binary tree where each level contains the maximum number of nodes i.e., every 
  level is completely full of nodes.

  # The number of nodes at depth 'd' (or level 'l') in a perfect binary tree = 2⁽ᵈ⁻¹⁾.
    Here depth (or level) is the number of nodes on path from root to the node, including the root itself.
    We are considering the depth (or level) of root is 1.

  # A perfect binary tree of height h has: 2ʰ − 1 nodes.
    Number of leaf nodes in a perfect binary tree of height h = 2⁽ʰ⁻¹⁾.   
    Here height is the max number of nodes on root to leaf path. 
    Here we are considering height of a tree with one node is 1.         

  # #internal nodes in a perfect binary tree of height h = (2ʰ − 1) - 2⁽ʰ⁻¹⁾
  														 = 2⁽ʰ⁻¹⁾ - 1
    Here we are considering height of a tree with one node is 1.  

• In normal in-order traversal we visit complete left subtree of a node before the right subtree. 
  If we visit complete right subtree before visiting the left subtree, it is referred as reverse in-order
  traversal.
  
• NOTE: As binary tree is one kind of tree; it has all properties of tree in graph theory.

#  (Inorder & Preorder) OR (Inorder & Postorder) uniquely identify a binary tree.
