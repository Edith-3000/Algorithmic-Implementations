# Euler tour on a Tree (also known as Flattening a Tree).

# Euler tour is not unique it depends on the implementation, most commonly it is of 2 types :--->
  1. Store the tree node every time you visit it.
  2. Store every node twice :-
     * When you visit it for the first time.
     * When it's whole subtree is explored.

# Euler tour only comes into picture when the tree is rooted, there is no point in talking about it if
  the tree is not rooted.

# Queries in a tree such as subtree queries or path queries can be solved many a times using binary lifting 
  (or LCA) but it becomes inefficient to use them when there are updates on the tree, so in such a case
  Euler Tour Representation of a Tree allows efficient updates and queries against a subtree of the tree.

# Think of using Euler Tour whenever you want to perform range queries/updates on a tree.
