# The diameter of a tree is the number of edges in the longest path in that tree.

# Pre-requisite Theorem: In a connected undirected acyclic graph, the furthest node that can be reached from any arbitrary node must be one end 
                         of the diameter of the graph.

# How to find the diameter of a tree - 
  1. Choose any arbitrary node 'u'.
  2. Either by DFS/BFS, find the node which is farthest from 'u', let's say 'v' ('v' will be one of the end points of the tree diameter).
  3. From 'v' again, find the distance of the node which is farthest from it, this distance will be the tree diameter.
