# In Graph Theory and Computer Science, the Lowest or Least Common Ancestor(LCA) of two nodes u and v in a 
  tree or a directed acyclic graph(DAG) is the lowest node that has both u and v as descendants, where we 
  define each node to be a descendant of itself . 

# Thus, The LCA of u and v is the ancestor of u and v such that it is located farthest from the root.

# Computation of LCA has many applications such as finding distance between pair of nodes in a tree,
  usage with Suffix trees for string processing and Computational Biology.

# LCA only comes into picture when the tree is rooted, there is no point in talking about LCA if the 
  tree is not rooted.
