/* Algorithm --->
   Step 1. Initialize the residual capacity matrix by assuming flow of each edge as 0 initially for every valid 
           edge pair (i, j) & for all other pair fill it with 0. Also initialize max_flow = 0.
   Step 2. Keep finding the augmenting path and increment max_flow accordingly.
           Stop if no augmenting path left.
