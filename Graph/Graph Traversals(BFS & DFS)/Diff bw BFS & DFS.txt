# SOME EXTRA POINTS ------->

* Breadth-first search is less space efficient than depth-first search because BFS keeps a priority queue 
  of the entire frontier while DFS maintains a few pointers at each level.

* BFS always returns an optimal answer, but this is not guaranteed for DFS.

* While BFS may seem slower, it’s actually deemed faster(although asymptotically both BFS & DFS have
  same runtime complexity) because if we were to implement them on larger graphs, you’ll find that DFS 
  wastes a lot of time going down long paths that are ultimately wrong. In fact, BFS is often used in 
  algorithms to determine the shortest path from one vertex to another.

* The memory taken by DFS/BFS heavily depends on the structure of our graph/tree. The maximum memory 
  taken by DFS (i.e. by recursion call stack) is equal to the depth of the tree and the maximum memory 
  taken by BFS is equal to the width of the tree.

* WHEN TO USE DFS AND BFS?
  # If it is known that an answer will likely be found far into a graph, DFS is a better option than BFS. 
  # BFS is good to use when the depth of the tree can vary or if a single answer is needed — for example, 
    the shortest path in a graph. 
  # If the entire graph is to be traversed, DFS is a better option.
  # If graph/tree is very wide, use DFS as BFS will take too much memory. 
    Similarly if graph/tree is very deep, choose BFS over DFS.
