# At the beginning and end of each search call we remember the 𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒓𝒚/𝒅𝒊𝒔𝒄𝒐𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒚 and 𝒆𝒙𝒊𝒕 "𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒆" of each vertex. 
  Now we can find the answer for any pair of vertices (i,j) in O(1): vertex i is an ancestor of vertex j if 
  and only if 𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒓𝒚[𝒊] < 𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒓𝒚[𝒋] and 𝒆𝒙𝒊𝒕[𝒊] > 𝒆𝒙𝒊𝒕[𝒋].

# Articulation Points (or Cut Vertices): a vertex in an UG is called an articulation point if removing it and 
  all the edges associated with it results in the increase of the number of connected components in the graph.

# Strong Articulation Points (or Strong Cut Vertices): a vertex in a DG is called an strong articulation point
  if removing it and all the edges associated with it results in the increase of the number of strongly connected
  components in the graph.

# Articulation points(or Strong Articulation Points) represent vulnerabilities in a connected network – single
  points whose failure would split the network into 2 or more components. They are useful for designing reliable 
  networks.

# Bridge: An edge (u,v)∈E is a bridge if its removal increases the number of connected components of an UG.
          (Note: only the edge is removed not the 2 vertices associated with it).

# Strong Bridge: An edge (u,v)∈E is a strong bridge if its removal increases the number of strongly connected
                 components of a DG.
                 (Note: only the edge is removed not the 2 vertices associated with it).

# 𝑳𝒐𝒘𝒆𝒔𝒕 𝑻𝒊𝒎𝒆: for a vertex 'x' it is the minimum of entry(or discovery) times of all the vertices that are 
                pointed by a backedge from any of the vertex present in the subtree (rooted at'x') of the vertex 
                'x'.
                If vertex 'x' has no children or there is no backedge present in the subtree, then 
                lowestTime[x] = entryTime[x].
