# In Graph Theory and Computer Science, the Lowest Common Ancestor(LCA) of two nodes u and v in a tree or a
  directed acyclic graph(DAG) is the lowest node that has both u and v as descendants,where we define each node to be a descendant of itself . 

# Thus, The LCA of u and v is the ancestor of u and v such that it is located farthest from the root.

# Computation of LCA has many applications such as finding distance between pair of nodes in a tree , 
  Usage with Suffix trees for string processing and Computational Biology.
