        VERY MUSH SIMILAR & THINGS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH SLIGHT MODIFICATIONS ONLY.

# 𝑬𝒖𝒍𝒆𝒓 𝒑𝒂𝒕𝒉: It is a path that passes through 𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒚 𝒆𝒅𝒈𝒆 exactly once. If it ends at the initial vertex 
              then it is an 𝑬𝒖𝒍𝒆𝒓 𝒄𝒚𝒄𝒍𝒆/𝒄𝒊𝒓𝒄𝒖𝒊𝒕.
              or we can say Euler cycle/circuit is a Euler path which starts & ends at the same vertex.

# Therefore conditions for Euler Circuit --->
  1. Start = End
  2. Every edge must be visited exactly once.

# In an Euler path you might pass through a vertex more than once.

# 𝑬𝒖𝒍𝒆𝒓 𝑮𝒓𝒂𝒑𝒉: It is a graph having an Eulerian Circuit.
# Therefore conditions for Euler Graph --->
  1. It must have a Euler Circuit & all the 𝑬𝑫𝑮𝑬𝑺 must be present in a single component of the graph.
  2. All the other components of the graph should not have any edge & hence should be of size 1 vertex only.

# Finally in a more refined manner, conditions for Euler Graph --->
  i. Start node = End node in the traversal.
  ii. Every edge of the graph should be visited exactly once in the traversal.
  Now point i & ii can be condensed in a single point i.e. 
  1. All the vertices should have 𝑬𝑽𝑬𝑵 𝑫𝑬𝑮𝑹𝑬𝑬.
  2. All the vertices with non zero degree must be present in a single component only, rest all the 
     vertices should have degree = 0.

# 𝑺𝒆𝒎𝒊 𝑬𝒖𝒍𝒆𝒓𝒊𝒂𝒏 𝑮𝒓𝒂𝒑𝒉 conditions --->
  1. Every edge is visited exactly once in the traversal.
  2. But start vertex is 𝑵𝑶𝑻 𝑬𝑸𝑼𝑨𝑳 to end vertex.

  or in a more refined manner, conditions for Semi Eulerian Graph --->
  1. Exactly 2 vertices (the start & end vertex) must have 𝑶𝑫𝑫 𝑫𝑬𝑮𝑹𝑬𝑬.
  2. All the vertices with non zero degree must be present in a single component only, rest all the 
     vertices should have degree = 0.

# How to find whether a given graph is Eulerian or not ?
  The problem is same as following question. “Is it possible to draw a given graph without lifting pencil from 
  the paper and without tracing any of the edges more than once”.

# 𝑨𝒍𝒈𝒐𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒉𝒎 for finding whether a graph is Eulerian or Semi Eulerian or Non Eulerian --->
  Step 1. Connectivity check ==> to check if all the edges are present in a single component or not
          (to handle the case of multi component graph).
          Now, find a node with degree > 0, 
                    if no such node found --> Euler Graph, exit the algorithm.
                    else: do DFS with that node & mark all nodes as visited in the component
                          check if any node with degree > 0 is unvisited => if true then it is confirmed it 
                                                                            is not Euler Graph
                                                                            now move to Step 2.

 If the graph passes Step 1, then we can't necessarily claim that it is a Euler Graph, so apply below step.
 Step 2. Count the #nodes with odd degree using the adjacency list
         if(count == 0) ==> Euler Graph
         if(count == 2) ==> Semi Euler Graph
         if(count > 2) ==> Non Euler Graph

 # Time complexity of the above algorithm = O(|V| + |E|)

# 𝑯𝒂𝒎𝒊𝒍𝒕𝒐𝒏𝒊𝒂𝒏 𝑷𝒂𝒕𝒉: It is a path that passes through 𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒚 𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒕𝒆𝒙 exactly once (NOT every edge). 
                     If it ends at the initial vertex then it is a 𝑯𝒂𝒎𝒊𝒍𝒕𝒐𝒏𝒊𝒂𝒏 𝒄𝒚𝒄𝒍𝒆/𝒄𝒊𝒓𝒄𝒖𝒊𝒕.
                     or we can say Hamiltonian cycle visit every vertex in the graph exactly once as well as
                     starting & ending at the same vertex (similar to the travelling salesman problem).
                     As a result, all vertices are traversed exactly once & each edge will be traversed 
                     AT MOST ONCE in Hamiltonian Cycle.

# In a Hamiltonian path you may not pass through all edges.

# Eulerian Path - A path of edges that visits ALL the edges in a graph exactly ONCE.

# Not all graphs have Eulerian Paths.

# If a graph has Eulerian Circuit then you can start your path/circuit from any node.

# Eulerian Circuit/Eulerian Cycle - An Eulerian Path which starts and ends on the same node.

# If a graph has all vertices with even degree and is connected, then it has an Eulerian circuit.

# Eulerian Graph - A graph having euler circuit.

# Semi-Eulerian Graph - A graph having euler path but not having euler circuit.

# In a Euler Path which is not a Euler Circuit, the start and end nodes will always have odd degrees and the 
  intermediate nodes will have even degrees.

# For a directed graph to have a Euler Circuit the INDEGREE = OUTDEGREE for all the nodes and any node can
  an be the start point of the circuit.

# For a directed graph to have a Euler Path (and not having Euler Circuit), following conditions should meet -
  1. There should be exactly 1 node with OUTDEGREE - INDEGREE = 1;
  2. There should be exactly 1 node with INDEGREE - OUTDEGREE = 1;
  3. For all the other nodes OUTDEGREE = INDEGREE.
